You`ve totally got this!
You are a great person and you are living your own success story. Forget everyone whoever made you doubt that.
You are always enough.
Today was probably hard. But you`re a fighter and you will get through this one too.
In case no one said it today. You are beautiful.
You deserve to be happy
It`s time to start choosing yourself for a change.
No matter what happens in life. Be proud of yourself.
It`s not crazy wanting to push yourself to be better. No matter how you get there.
Regardless the countless battles you are fighting or have fought in your life. You`ve already won and I`m proud of you.
Stay focus and stay positive. You`re almost there.
The things you hide from the world. I hope you can heal from the scars it left behind.
You are on the right path. Sometimes it may seem dark, but keep searching for that light. It`s there.
It`s okay not to be okay.
Yes, the past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it... ot learn from it.
Words and actions can be painful. But you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think. Those that doubt you can only dream to think things like that.
